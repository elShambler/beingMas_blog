&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-year-anniversary:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;1-Year Anniversary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend (09/05/2015) is the 2015 Rut in Big Sky, Montana. That means it&amp;rsquo;s been
one year since I had the opportunity to race there. I never got around to
writing a race report and decided this would be the best time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rut is becoming a very popular race as it is one of the few true sky/mountain races
in the USA. It is featured in the SkyRunner World Series, along with the USA Series.
Last year (when I ran it) it featured top athletes such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%ADlian_Jornet_Burgada&#34;&gt;Kilian Jornet&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sagecanaday.com/athlete/&#34;&gt;Sage Canaday&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://running.competitor.com/2014/07/trail-running/runner-struck-lightning-keeps-running_107955&#34;&gt;Adam Campbell&lt;/a&gt;
 (among others), and Emelie Forsberg, Kasie Enman, and Anna &amp;ldquo;Frosty&amp;rdquo; Frost. The race director is Mike Foote
 (who got 2nd this year at Hardrock 100, behind Kilian) and put together quite an
epic course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;backstory:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May of 2014, I moved to Pittsburgh, PA from Houston, TX. Not going to lie, I had a challenging time with the transition and saying goodbye to my home, family, and friends.
In an attempt to find fulfillment in my new city and home, I decided to focus on running - trail running. With this new determiniation, I figured I should start reading
about it too - so I picked up an issue of Trail Runner Magazine to begin this new hobby of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magazine has a section called &amp;ldquo;Featured Races&amp;rdquo; and this particular magazine had one titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://trailrunnermag.com/races/15-featured-races/1466-the-rut-50k&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Rut 50k&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
I read it, thought it sounded epic, and decided right then and there to look it up on my computer. Sure enough, it was sold out&amp;hellip; but they were accepting names
into their waiting list. My thought process was something like - &amp;ldquo;If I sign up, maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll give me motivation to train for it next year when I actually get in.&amp;rdquo; So I signed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started running more on the trails, I was also nursing a knee injury that the doctors told me I needed surgery for. I actually went as far as scheduling the surgery. However,
after running more on the trails, and doing cross-training with picking up crossfit, my knee actually started feeling better. I canceled the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;training:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tcastillo.me/images/2014Rut/EmailConfirmation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I made it off the wait list!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early August (6th of August), I got an email that said I made it in! I was shocked. The race was September 13th meaning I now had to go from running like 10 miles a week to
running 31 miles up a mountain in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I had done a 50k in Texas and considered myself a decent runner/athlete prior to moving to Pittsburgh, I soon realized there was one aspect that I was very new to - hills.
Houston has no hills, and I quickly learned that running on the trails where there is elevation change IS NOT the same as running on flat ground. I made sure that my training took
into account many hills and long distancese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I learned a lot in those 6 weeks I had to train: I learned how to run on rocky terrain (kind of); I got better at running on a treadmill for long periods of time since a
bachelor party to Las Vegas left me with that option for getting hill work in; and I pushed myself to go long distance by myself and self-sustained. Come September 13th, I was as
ready&amp;hellip; or at least as much as I could&amp;rsquo;ve with really only 6 weeks of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-race:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Pre-Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tcastillo.me/images/2014Rut/AirportView.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Airport view of Bozeman Mountains&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew in to Bozeman Montana all hyped up and ready to take on the challenge of the race. In order to acclimatize to the altitude better, I flew in 12 hours before the race (&lt;em&gt;joke&lt;/em&gt;).
It actually worked out really well because my college roommate (3 out of 4 years) lived in Bozeman, so I was grateful that I go to spend time with the great Danny Z. It turned out
to be poor timing on my end because Danny was in his best friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding that weekend (maybe just coincidental). Either way, though, it allowed me a place to stay, and I got to
meet some of his friends and help out a little before the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue for the wedding was actually spectacular. I took some time and helped his friend and fiance unload tables and chairs and move stuff around. The venue wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully finished
at the time, but they were making it work. I took some pictures, got to the know the groom and bride, and then borrowed Danny&amp;rsquo;s car as I drove off to the Big Sky resort for check-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I was driving up to the mountain, I realized it was too late - I couldn&amp;rsquo;t abandon ship now&amp;hellip; I had already paid my entry fee, paid for a flight, and what&amp;rsquo;s worse is I told
DZ and his lover friends that I would be running the race, so backing out would seem pretty lame. The issue was - Lone Peak (THE mountain at Big Sky) is a &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; mountain, and at
11,166 ft, I was beginning to question whether I had really thought this out and trained properly. Nonetheless, the atmosphere was quite energetic and I was almost mezmerized myself
in the fact that I actually made it and was about to embark on an extremely challenging but amazing adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned in for the night back at DZ&amp;rsquo;s place (he was actually living with the groom&amp;rsquo;s (Joey) place, so Joey&amp;rsquo;s place) after hanging for a bit with his friends, before getting up early
enough to make the drive to Big Sky and get warmed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;race-day:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Race Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached the staging area for the resort in the darkness of dawn, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think how this seems to be starting a new chapter to my life - here I am at a race where
I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone, it&amp;rsquo;s a distance that I&amp;rsquo;ve done before but I&amp;rsquo;ll be climbing a mountain, and all in, it&amp;rsquo;ll be epic if I finish. I was pumped! The temperature in the morning was
a cool 38 *F but slated to rise up to 60 *F with clear skies - perfect racing weather. I had my backpack filled with food, water, and room for a jacket once it warmed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race started in 3 heats - fast, intermediate, and slow. I think I picked the intermediate group just because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait any longer. We started in the dark and
immediately started climbing upwards. I was quite shocked at the fact that we were walking right at the start - wasn&amp;rsquo;t this a race? Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we running? So I tried running
up the hill to pass people&amp;hellip; I quickly found out why we were walking. My legs started burning and I was moving at roughly the same speed as the walkers, but sucking 2x the
amount of air. Walking it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I figured that lesson out, the race became a little more manageable. I ran when I could, walked fast on the uphills. I tried running the downhills quickly, but was no match
for the more experienced runners. I watched their technique as they seemed to glide over rocky downhill terrain that looked like it could roll a few ankles. I tried to keep at my
own pace and not focus too much on the fact that I was being passed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pennsylvania&#39;s Steepest Race</title>
      <link>http://tcastillo.me/post/SteepestRacePA/</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spark-of-the-project:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;The Spark of the Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I went on a run with the North Park Trail Runners,
and a discussion came up about different races people signed up for.
It inevitably led to a conversation about how tough each race is.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, if you are doing a race, it will be challenging
no matter what - if it&amp;rsquo;s flat, you&amp;rsquo;re probably pushing your body to
go real fast; if it&amp;rsquo;s a little hilly, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re sprinting up all
the hills; or if it&amp;rsquo;s very steep, you&amp;rsquo;ll be walking up the climbs and
running down the hills or trotting (and even the downhill can be
challenging based on the terrain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while there is no one true metric to answer the question
of &amp;ldquo;what is the most challenging race?&amp;rdquo;,
I have attempted to answer a piece of that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-races-with-hills:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;The Races With Hills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hill - get over it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my time here in Pennsylvania, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the names of different
races thrown around - Rothrock Challenge, Megatransect, Lost Turkey, etc.
I tried going through some of those races and quantifying the vertical gain per mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky thing here is that not every race advertises its
estimated elevation gain, and even if it does, you can&amp;rsquo;t always
trust it (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Rock&amp;rsquo;N The Knob). You also can&amp;rsquo;t trust the
advertised miles - actually, nor the ruuners&amp;hellip; well,
especially the runners that like to challenge themselves and
add extra off-course miles (I do this quite often&amp;hellip; some people call it getting lost).
To assist with accuracy, I gathered together GPS data for the different races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a small list of &amp;ldquo;challening&amp;rdquo; races
and pulled out their elevation gain in feet and divided
it by the total miles of the race, based on data recorded from racers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the races are as follows (in alphabetical order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wilds Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eastern States 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyner View Challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laurel Highlands Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Megatransect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rock&amp;rsquo;N the Knob&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rothrock Challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADDED&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frozen Snot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laurel Highlands (50K)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worlds End Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worlds End Ultra (50K)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirty Kiln Half Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can update/add to this list as I do more research and get more suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tcastillo.me/images/SteepPA/SteepestPARace.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Graph of vertical gain (ft) per mile&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By purely looking at numbers, the Frozen Snot is by far the steepest race with 389 ft/mile.
What makes that race even more of a challenge is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s held at the end of
January. Aside from that, the Wilds Marathon has the second most vertical gain per mile at 258 ft/mile,
with the Hyner View Challenge (50K) coming in closely behind it at 256 ft/mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you can see for yourself, all the numbers that went into the graph above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tcastillo.me/images/SteepPA/RaceData.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Race data&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to add in the Pittsburgh Marathon for reference on how a &amp;ldquo;hilly&amp;rdquo; road race compares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the crux of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying relies on data that I put together,
I think it is worthwhile noting where it came from. I tried to gather
together blog race reports and the numbers that people reported there,
but I was also able to track down some data from publicly available sources (i.e. Strava).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be thorough with my results, I tried using a decent sample size to
get an average worth reporting since I know the way GPS works varies
between watches and the different algorithms companies utilize.
Decent sample size meant 4 or more people (not that many, I know,
but finding the data was hard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;distance:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Distance&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distance category for the race should be obvious,
that&amp;rsquo;s where you know the distance you&amp;rsquo;re signing up for&amp;hellip;
roughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the reported distance is what was ran.
The data used here was the GPS recorded distance. I compiled
different racer&amp;rsquo;s data, and averaged them together. I tried to
ensure the GPS route followed the plotted course for the race,
although this was more of a rough estimate. I also tried to make
sure the distance made sense and that the runners finished the
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All races cannot guarantee you&amp;rsquo;ll run the exact amount that was
initially advertised though, and it may depend on the
course you take (i.e. getting lost). The one interesting result
was the Laurel Highlands coming in about 3 miles short. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
run the race, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where the discrepancy would come in.
Potentially, the uphill + downhill gains could make up the 3 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;elevation:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Elevation&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevation was the main data that I used for my thoughts here.
Elevation is a tricky thing. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details, but
&lt;a href=&#34;http://regex.info/blog/2015-05-09/2568&#34;&gt;Jeff Friedl&lt;/a&gt; blogged about
how Strava may inflate/overestimate their elevation numbers. It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to
tell, and quite honestly, I used Strava for 95% of my data,
so at least they&amp;rsquo;re all consistently inflated (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, again, used the same method of just pulling different
racer&amp;rsquo;s GPS Elevation gain data and then averaged at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that the Wilds Marathon is the toughest race in PA?
Heck no! The distance of the Eastern States add a whole new element
of pain to the table. But then you have Rothrock and Megatransect
that both add a layer of complexity with the amount of rocks and
technical portions that also make it challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of trail running is each race offers its own set of
challenges. I think the lesson to learn here is you may need to try
each one to determine which is the most challenging for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blogging With Hugo</title>
      <link>http://tcastillo.me/post/bloggingwithhugo/</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hello-world:837b790d0077db53636026f3d2aee5f3&#34;&gt;Hello World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have finally decided to do something with this website of mine.
For a while it&amp;rsquo;s been sitting here with a static page on top, but with some spare time
and a bit of desire for a challenge, I have updated the site. The goal will be to
continue to blog on it, while adding additional content to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main focus will be some of my random adventures in life, but at the same time I&amp;rsquo;ll
be blogging from time to time about my trials of maintaining this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built the site using &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and picked up a theme called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vjeantet/hugo-theme-casper&#34;&gt;Casper&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a little tricky
since I&amp;rsquo;m going about the blog in an odd fashion. First I edit files on my computer
at work/home/phone. Then I use git to push the content to github. Then, when I get
a chance, I&amp;rsquo;ll use git to pull the changed content on my VPS with Digital Ocean. Once there,
I use Hugo to generate the static pages for the content, which is then copied
to a separate location which is where NGINX picks up the content and puts it
on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Steps&#34;&gt;hugo new -t casper post/BloggingWithHugo.md
** Write blog post in notepad **

git push https://github.com/elShambler/beingMas_blog

** Log in to VPS **
git pull
hugo -t casper
cp -r public/* &amp;lt;/location/for/nginx/host&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convoluted and most likely unnecessary. Because this is my first real experience with
maintaing a webserver, it is a constant learning process. With any luck, I will have
greater efficiency in the future. For now, this method will have to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing to try is symlinks and/or rsync to just copy the files directly for nginx
to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
