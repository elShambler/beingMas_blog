&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-year-anniversary:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;1-Year Anniversary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend (09/05/2015) is the 2015 Rut in Big Sky, Montana. That means it&amp;rsquo;s been
one year since I had the opportunity to race there. I never got around to
writing a race report and decided this would be the best time to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rut is becoming a very popular race as it is one of the few true sky/mountain races
in the USA. It is featured in the SkyRunner World Series, along with the USA Series.
Last year (when I ran it) it featured top athletes such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%ADlian_Jornet_Burgada&#34;&gt;Kilian Jornet&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a href=&#34;http://sagecanaday.com/athlete/&#34;&gt;Sage Canaday&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://running.competitor.com/2014/07/trail-running/runner-struck-lightning-keeps-running_107955&#34;&gt;Adam Campbell&lt;/a&gt;
 (among others), and Emelie Forsberg, Kasie Enman, and Anna &amp;ldquo;Frosty&amp;rdquo; Frost. The race director is Mike Foote
 (who got 2nd this year at Hardrock 100, behind Kilian) and put together quite an
epic course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;backstory:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May of 2014, I moved to Pittsburgh, PA from Houston, TX. Not going to lie, I had a challenging time with the transition and saying goodbye to my home, family, and friends.
In an attempt to find fulfillment in my new city and home, I decided to focus on running - trail running. With this new determiniation, I figured I should start reading
about it too - so I picked up an issue of Trail Runner Magazine to begin this new hobby of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magazine has a section called &amp;ldquo;Featured Races&amp;rdquo; and this particular magazine had one titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://trailrunnermag.com/races/15-featured-races/1466-the-rut-50k&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Rut 50k&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.
I read it, thought it sounded epic, and decided right then and there to look it up on my computer. Sure enough, it was sold out&amp;hellip; but they were accepting names
into their waiting list. My thought process was something like - &amp;ldquo;If I sign up, maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll give me motivation to train for it next year when I actually get in.&amp;rdquo; So I signed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started running more on the trails, I was also nursing a knee injury that the doctors told me I needed surgery for. I actually went as far as scheduling the surgery. However,
after running more on the trails, and doing cross-training with picking up crossfit, my knee actually started feeling better. I canceled the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;training:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Training&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tcastillo.me/images/2014Rut/EmailConfirmation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;I made it off the wait list!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early August (6th of August), I got an email that said I made it in! I was shocked. The race was September 13th meaning I now had to go from running like 10 miles a week to
running 31 miles up a mountain in one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I had done a 50k in Texas and considered myself a decent runner/athlete prior to moving to Pittsburgh, I soon realized there was one aspect that I was very new to - hills.
Houston has no hills, and I quickly learned that running on the trails where there is elevation change IS NOT the same as running on flat ground. I made sure that my training took
into account many hills and long distancese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I learned a lot in those 6 weeks I had to train: I learned how to run on rocky terrain (kind of); I got better at running on a treadmill for long periods of time since a
bachelor party to Las Vegas left me with that option for getting hill work in; and I pushed myself to go long distance by myself and self-sustained. Come September 13th, I was as
ready&amp;hellip; or at least as much as I could&amp;rsquo;ve with really only 6 weeks of training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-race:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Pre-Race&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://tcastillo.me/images/2014Rut/AirportView.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Airport view of Bozeman Mountains&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flew in to Bozeman Montana all hyped up and ready to take on the challenge of the race. In order to acclimatize to the altitude better, I flew in 12 hours before the race (&lt;em&gt;joke&lt;/em&gt;).
It actually worked out really well because my college roommate (3 out of 4 years) lived in Bozeman, so I was grateful that I go to spend time with the great Danny Z. It turned out
to be poor timing on my end because Danny was in his best friend&amp;rsquo;s wedding that weekend (maybe just coincidental). Either way, though, it allowed me a place to stay, and I got to
meet some of his friends and help out a little before the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venue for the wedding was actually spectacular. I took some time and helped his friend and fiance unload tables and chairs and move stuff around. The venue wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully finished
at the time, but they were making it work. I took some pictures, got to the know the groom and bride, and then borrowed Danny&amp;rsquo;s car as I drove off to the Big Sky resort for check-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I was driving up to the mountain, I realized it was too late - I couldn&amp;rsquo;t abandon ship now&amp;hellip; I had already paid my entry fee, paid for a flight, and what&amp;rsquo;s worse is I told
DZ and his lover friends that I would be running the race, so backing out would seem pretty lame. The issue was - Lone Peak (THE mountain at Big Sky) is a &lt;strong&gt;BIG&lt;/strong&gt; mountain, and at
11,166 ft, I was beginning to question whether I had really thought this out and trained properly. Nonetheless, the atmosphere was quite energetic and I was almost mezmerized myself
in the fact that I actually made it and was about to embark on an extremely challenging but amazing adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned in for the night back at DZ&amp;rsquo;s place (he was actually living with the groom&amp;rsquo;s (Joey) place, so Joey&amp;rsquo;s place) after hanging for a bit with his friends, before getting up early
enough to make the drive to Big Sky and get warmed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;race-day:7f89b66f2dfb35eb5d4774d8834292c1&#34;&gt;Race Day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached the staging area for the resort in the darkness of dawn, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think how this seems to be starting a new chapter to my life - here I am at a race where
I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone, it&amp;rsquo;s a distance that I&amp;rsquo;ve done before but I&amp;rsquo;ll be climbing a mountain, and all in, it&amp;rsquo;ll be epic if I finish. I was pumped! The temperature in the morning was
a cool 38 *F but slated to rise up to 60 *F with clear skies - perfect racing weather. I had my backpack filled with food, water, and room for a jacket once it warmed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race started in 3 heats - fast, intermediate, and slow. I think I picked the intermediate group just because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait any longer. We started in the dark and
immediately started climbing upwards. I was quite shocked at the fact that we were walking right at the start - wasn&amp;rsquo;t this a race? Why aren&amp;rsquo;t we running? So I tried running
up the hill to pass people&amp;hellip; I quickly found out why we were walking. My legs started burning and I was moving at roughly the same speed as the walkers, but sucking 2x the
amount of air. Walking it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I figured that lesson out, the race became a little more manageable. I ran when I could, walked fast on the uphills. I tried running the downhills quickly, but was no match
for the more experienced runners. I watched their technique as they seemed to glide over rocky downhill terrain that looked like it could roll a few ankles. I tried to keep at my
own pace and not focus too much on the fact that I was being passed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
