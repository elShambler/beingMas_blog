&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Hyner_AdamAndClayton-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;No. 2 and No. 4 Atop Humble Hill&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my two years living in Pennsylvania, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to understand just how
beautiful Pennsylvania is. Truly, there are many different ways to
experience the natural wonders of the state. However, in central PA, the
trails are rugged and hills are steep and relentless, traveling by foot
is the best way to explore the wilds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hikerun.com&#34;&gt;Hyner Trail Challenge&lt;/a&gt; showcases some of the best
parts of PA while is simultaneously grueling and unforgiving - whether
you&amp;rsquo;re challenging yourself with the 25 km or 50 km. It traverses
through the winding creeks and ridge sides of Hyner View State park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Hyner_hangGlideTakeoff.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hyner View&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the 50k race boasts upwards of 7500 feet of elevation gain, the
25k is no joke either, as it climbs 3 of the same &amp;ldquo;hills&amp;rdquo; as the 50k
giving it over 4500 feet of elevation gain. Over both of those
distances, you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself in a beautiful and remote part of the
park and state, and often times questioning why you thought this
challenge was a good idea to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-hyner-why-50k:264e03aa8d6ea86b3f80d7d78d6fed0e&#34;&gt;Why Hyner? Why 50k?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race has been going on since 2007, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2008 that the
25k course was established to what it is today. In 2012, there were
enough crazy people to offer a 50k variant. Last year was really my
first foray into the Pennsylvania trail running scene, and the first
race I did was the Hyner 25k and was hooked. This year I got to do the
50k. I may do a separate post for a race report, but here is a quick
summary - a perfect blend of beauty, steep climbs, and runnable single
track - &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; would recommend to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a lot of people got my recommendation, as I was quite surprised by
the number of people that turned up for the 50k this year. Although, I
will say, the number of people in the 25k last year was shocking to me
as well; the sign of a good race. With the increase in number of
entrants, my competitive mind began to wonder if there was an increase
in the amount of talent that was present as well. But if there was, how
much? Was this year faster overall? And why were there so many fast
people here??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of factors probably went in to its increase in popularity: the
overall trend of the popularity of the sport for both sub-ultra and
ultra distances; the 25k and 50k are both part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trailrunnermag.com/races/trophy-series&#34;&gt;Trail Runner Magazine&amp;rsquo;s Trophy Series&lt;/a&gt;,
for the second year in a row; the 25k is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mountaincup.com/schedule&#34;&gt;La Sportiva Mountain Cup&lt;/a&gt;;
and the 50k is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://patriplecrown.com/&#34;&gt;Pennsylvania Triple Crown of Mountain Running&lt;/a&gt;.
So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I could go in to detail about the 25k, I&amp;rsquo;ll touch on it briefly,
but my curiousity lies with the 50k&amp;hellip; partly because that is the race I
participated in, but also because the ultra distance is still a newer
category but quickly gaining in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;everyone-likes-a-challenge:264e03aa8d6ea86b3f80d7d78d6fed0e&#34;&gt;Everyone Likes A Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to when the 50k races began, there were initially 99 entrants
in the race. Now there are 258. My how the times have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Race%20Participants-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Race Participants&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might notice that in 2015, the 25k has the most participants and
decreased in 2016 - this is due to the increased interest in the 50k.
There are certain rules that allow for a certain number of people to be
out on the course at one time. Because of the rising popularity of the
50k, the number of entrants allowed to the 25k was cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year, 2016 saw the most challengers on the 50k course and an
increase from 155 people to 258. So with the added number of legs and
competition on the course, how does this change the speed of the
finishers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-faster:264e03aa8d6ea86b3f80d7d78d6fed0e&#34;&gt;Getting Faster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, as you may have guessed, the field got faster - well at least the
competition at the top did. While the 25k brings in some top notch
talent, the overall pace of that race category is slower than than 50k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Speed%20Comparison-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Speed Comparison&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens simply because there are runners and hikers taking on the
25k, while the 50k is reserved for anyone that has met the time
constraints on a qualifying race. So there&amp;rsquo;s a selective process for
those attempting the 50k, along with the fact that it is truly a
difficult race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the 25k is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you then look at how the top finisher&amp;rsquo;s times have increased over the
years - you can get a sense for how the speed has been growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Hyner_MattLipsey.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;No. 1 in 25k - Matt Lipsey&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the average times went up actually. &lt;a href=&#34;http://matthiaslipshitz.blogspot.com/2016/04/hyner-worth-view.html&#34;&gt;Matt Lipsey commented on how that year felt slow&lt;/a&gt;,
and it was certainly reflected in finishing times. Otherwise, with the
increase in participants to the 50k, the finishers times got way faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Top%2010%20Pace-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Top 10 Average Pace&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this because the race is growing in size, so the number of fast
people entering is increasing? Or maybe the same people are putting in
more training and more rigorous training to be faster than last year?
Probably a combination of both. But you can definitely see how the depth
of the field is increasing as well. By that, I mean, the number of
people clustered around the same times and how easy it is to jump ranks
based on an increase in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the standard deviation. I left this part out, but the
competition has certainly become tighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you can see overall times and just how fast the 50k has become -
below shows the top 25 finisher&amp;rsquo;s times (not pace). Simply astounding
how fast this race has become. Makes you wonder what it will look like
next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/50k%20Finish%20Times-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;50k Finish Times&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opt-outside:264e03aa8d6ea86b3f80d7d78d6fed0e&#34;&gt;Opt Outside&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Hyner2016/Hyner_alongWall.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Along the Hyner Lookout&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just people wanting to be more active, or more people
wanting to challenge themselves, or just wanting to get
outside - something is definitely happening to the Pennsylvania trail
racing scene, and for the better. With the added incentives this year of
the 25k and 50k variants, along with people striving to best their own
times from previous years, the growing number of people is sure to bring
in a growing number of talented legs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to being able to see what the rest of the year brings and
how the newer races fare. With Worlds End 100k in only its second year,
and Eastern States 100 in its third, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be more top racers
emerging from the technical, gritty, and rooty trails that this state
has to offer. Best to get out there and keep running!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pennsylvania&#39;s Steepest Race</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-spark-of-the-project:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;The Spark of the Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I went on a run with the North Park Trail Runners,
and a discussion came up about different races people signed up for.
It inevitably led to a conversation about how tough each race is.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, if you are doing a race, it will be challenging
no matter what - if it&amp;rsquo;s flat, you&amp;rsquo;re probably pushing your body to
go real fast; if it&amp;rsquo;s a little hilly, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re sprinting up all
the hills; or if it&amp;rsquo;s very steep, you&amp;rsquo;ll be walking up the climbs and
running down the hills or trotting (and even the downhill can be
challenging based on the terrain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while there is no one true metric to answer the question
of &amp;ldquo;what is the most challenging race?&amp;rdquo;,
I have attempted to answer a piece of that puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-races-with-hills:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;The Races With Hills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hill - get over it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my time here in Pennsylvania, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard the names of different
races thrown around - Rothrock Challenge, Megatransect, Lost Turkey, etc.
I tried going through some of those races and quantifying the vertical gain per mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tricky thing here is that not every race advertises its
estimated elevation gain, and even if it does, you can&amp;rsquo;t always
trust it. You also can&amp;rsquo;t trust the advertised miles - actually, nor the ruuners&amp;hellip; well,
especially the runners that like to challenge themselves and
add extra off-course miles (I do this quite often&amp;hellip; some people call it getting lost).
To assist with accuracy, I gathered together GPS data for the different races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a small list of &amp;ldquo;challening&amp;rdquo; races
and pulled out their elevation gain in feet and divided
it by the total miles of the race, based on data recorded from racers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far the races are as follows (in alphabetical order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call of the Wilds Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eastern States 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyner View Challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laurel Highlands Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Megatransect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rock&amp;rsquo;N the Knob&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rothrock Challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frozen Snot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laurel Highlands (50K)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worlds End Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worlds End Ultra (50K)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dirty Kiln Half Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pittsburgh Marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel Carson Trail Challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glacier Ridge Trail Ultra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glacier Ridge Trail Ultra (50k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hell Hath No Hurry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hell Hath No Hurry (50k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I can update/add to this list as I do more research and get more suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorizing the races by their elevation gain/mile only reveals one degree of difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/SteepPA/SteepestPARace.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Graph of vertical gain (ft) per mile&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By purely looking at numbers, the Frozen Snot is by far the steepest race with 389 ft/mile.
What makes that race even more of a challenge is the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s held at the end of
January. Aside from that, the Wilds Marathon has the second most vertical gain per mile at 258 ft/mile,
with the Hyner View Challenge (50K) coming in closely behind it at 256 ft/mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you can see for yourself, all the numbers that went into the graph above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/SteepPA/RaceData.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Race data&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to add in the Pittsburgh Marathon for reference on how a &amp;ldquo;hilly&amp;rdquo; road race compares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-with-interactive-graph:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Update with Interactive Graph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this data into a CSV file and used a webservice called &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.ly&#34;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; to
style the data a little differently than excel was letting me and add comprehension to the races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See below:
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.ly/~elShambler/244/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;PA Races - Races by pace and Elevation gain/mile&#34; style=&#34;display: block; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://plot.ly/~elShambler/244.png&#34; alt=&#34;PA Races - Races by pace and Elevation gain/mile&#34; style=&#34;max-width: 100%;width: 1598px;&#34;  width=&#34;1598&#34; onerror=&#34;this.onerror=null;this.src=&#39;https://plot.ly/404.png&#39;;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly=&#34;elShambler:244&#34;  src=&#34;https://plot.ly/embed.js&#34; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have added some additional data that I used to make this plot - pace. I grabbed an average of
the top 10 finishers&amp;rsquo; paces and used that as an additional data point to graph against. The
reasoning behind this and the above graph is to add additional character to the different
races.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hope in including this data is to give an overall enlightenment to how a race
will feel when it comes time for raceday. The higher the bubble is, the slower
pace you can expect, and the darker the bubble, the more climbing there is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something kind of interesting that I have been pondering after making this graph is
if there is some sort of plateau of base pace for varying lengths of races. I know
that as the body&amp;rsquo;s metabolism switches systems over long periods of high expenditure,
the pace will drop, but wonder how it plays into elevation gain too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;data:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the crux of what I&amp;rsquo;m saying relies on data that I put together,
I think it is worthwhile noting where it came from. I tried to gather
together blog race reports and the numbers that people reported there,
but I was also able to track down some data from publicly available sources (i.e. Strava).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be thorough with my results, I tried using a decent sample size to
get an average worth reporting since I know the way GPS works varies
between watches and the different algorithms companies utilize.
Decent sample size meant 4 or more people (not that many, I know,
but finding the data was hard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;distance:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Distance&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distance category for the race should be obvious,
that&amp;rsquo;s where you know the distance you&amp;rsquo;re signing up for&amp;hellip;
roughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the reported distance is what was ran.
The data used here was the GPS recorded distance. I compiled
different racer&amp;rsquo;s data, and averaged them together. I tried to
ensure the GPS route followed the plotted course for the race,
although this was more of a rough estimate. I also tried to make
sure the distance made sense and that the runners finished the
course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All races cannot guarantee you&amp;rsquo;ll run the exact amount that was
initially advertised though, and it may depend on the
course you take (i.e. getting lost). The one interesting result
was the Laurel Highlands coming in about 3 miles short. I haven&amp;rsquo;t
run the race, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where the discrepancy would come in.
Potentially, the uphill + downhill gains could make up the 3 miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;elevation:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Elevation&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevation was the main data that I used for my thoughts here.
Elevation is a tricky thing. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details, but
&lt;a href=&#34;http://regex.info/blog/2015-05-09/2568&#34;&gt;Jeff Friedl&lt;/a&gt; blogged about
how Strava may inflate/overestimate their elevation numbers. It&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to
tell, and quite honestly, I used Strava for 95% of my data,
so at least they&amp;rsquo;re all consistently inflated (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, again, used the same method of just pulling different
racer&amp;rsquo;s GPS Elevation gain data and then averaged at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts:e821d7f6a85bcd0c723ada71edb79d57&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that the Wilds Marathon or Frozen Snot is the toughest race in PA?
Heck no! The distance of the Eastern States add a whole new element
of pain to the table. But then you have Rothrock and Megatransect
that both add a layer of complexity with the amount of rocks and
technical portions that also make it challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Frozen Snot definitely is an interesting beast because of its
steep ascents over short distance - it approaches the climbing
difficulty of a VK (vertical kilometer race). Runnability is also
huge into the challenges of a race - this has to do with the
technicality of the course. As I said above, the body&amp;rsquo;s method
of producing energy shifts at a certain point (I don&amp;rsquo;t remember
what it is, but I want to say after maybe 8 hours of heavy
calorie expenditure?) and after that, maintaining a constant
energy output becomes even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say that no single race is quantitatively better than
another race. The beauty of trail running is each race offers its own set of
challenges. I think the lesson to learn here is you may need to try
each one to determine which is the most challenging for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
