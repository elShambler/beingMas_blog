## Who Am I?
I'm a normal guy working a normal job but try and push myself to
be more than just a desk slave.

I spend time running through the trails and getting a full dose of the outdoors.
I have begun running ultramarathons, but am still fairly new to the scene.

Other areas that I dabble in (i.e. hobbies, and not a professional) include:
+ Photography
+ Coding
+ Woodworking
+ Beekeeping

Thanks for checking me out!
