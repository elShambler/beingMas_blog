### 1-Year Anniversary
This weekend (09/05/2015) is the 2015 Rut in Big Sky, Montana. That means it's been
one year since I had the opportunity to race there. I never got around to
writing a race report and decided this would be the best time to do so.

### Overview
The Rut is becoming a very popular race as it is one of the few true sky/mountain races
in the USA. It is featured in the SkyRunner World Series, along with the USA Series.
Last year (when I ran it) it featured top athletes such as [Kilian Jornet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%ADlian_Jornet_Burgada)
, [Sage Canaday](http://sagecanaday.com/athlete/), and [Adam Campbell](http://running.competitor.com/2014/07/trail-running/runner-struck-lightning-keeps-running_107955)
 (among others), and Emelie Forsberg, Kasie Enman, and Anna "Frosty" Frost. The race director is Mike Foote 
 (who got 2nd this year at Hardrock 100, behind Kilian) and put together quite an
epic course.

#### Backstory
In May of 2014, I moved to Pittsburgh, PA from Houston, TX. Not going to lie, I had a challenging time with the transition and saying goodbye to my home, family, and friends.
In an attempt to find fulfillment in my new city and home, I decided to focus on running - trail running. With this new determiniation, I figured I should start reading
about it too - so I picked up an issue of Trail Runner Magazine to begin this new hobby of mine.

The magazine has a section called "Featured Races" and this particular magazine had one titled ["The Rut 50k"](http://trailrunnermag.com/races/15-featured-races/1466-the-rut-50k).
I read it, thought it sounded epic, and decided right then and there to look it up on my computer. Sure enough, it was sold out... but they were accepting names
into their waiting list. My thought process was something like - "If I sign up, maybe it'll give me motivation to train for it next year when I actually get in." So I signed up.

As I started running more on the trails, I was also nursing a knee injury that the doctors told me I needed surgery for. I actually went as far as scheduling the surgery. However,
after running more on the trails, and doing cross-training with picking up crossfit, my knee actually started feeling better. I canceled the surgery.

#### Training
![I made it off the wait list!](/images/2014Rut/EmailConfirmation.jpg)

In early August (6th of August), I got an email that said I made it in! I was shocked. The race was September 13th meaning I now had to go from running like 10 miles a week to
running 31 miles up a mountain in one day.

While I had done a 50k in Texas and considered myself a decent runner/athlete prior to moving to Pittsburgh, I soon realized there was one aspect that I was very new to - hills.
Houston has no hills, and I quickly learned that running on the trails where there is elevation change IS NOT the same as running on flat ground. I made sure that my training took
into account many hills and long distancese.

I think I learned a lot in those 6 weeks I had to train: I learned how to run on rocky terrain (kind of); I got better at running on a treadmill for long periods of time since a
bachelor party to Las Vegas left me with that option for getting hill work in; and I pushed myself to go long distance by myself and self-sustained. Come September 13th, I was as
ready... or at least as much as I could've with really only 6 weeks of training.

### Pre-Race

I flew in to Bozeman Montana all hyped up and ready to take on the challenge of the race. In order to acclimatize to the altitude better, I flew in 12 hours before the race (*joke*).
It actually worked out really well because my college roommate (3 out of 4 years) lived in Bozeman, so I was grateful that I go to spend time with the great Danny Z. It turned out
to be poor timing on my end because Danny was in his best friend's wedding that weekend (maybe just coincidental). Either way, though, it allowed me a place to stay, and I got to
meet some of his friends and help out a little before the wedding.

The venue for the wedding was actually spectacular. I took some time and helped his friend and fiance unload tables and chairs and move stuff around. The venue wasn't fully finished
at the time, but they were making it work. I took some pictures, got to the know the groom and bride, and then borrowed Danny's car as I drove off to the Big Sky resort for check-in.

By the time I was driving up to the mountain, I realized it was too late - I couldn't abandon ship now... I had already paid my entry fee, paid for a flight, and what's worse is I told
DZ and his lover friends that I would be running the race, so backing out would seem pretty lame. The issue was - Lone Peak (THE mountain at Big Sky) is a **BIG** mountain, and at
11,166 ft, I was beginning to question whether I had really thought this out and trained properly. Nonetheless, the atmosphere was quite energetic and I was almost mezmerized myself
in the fact that I actually made it and was about to embark on an extremely challenging but amazing adventure!

I turned in for the night back at DZ's place (he was actually living with the groom's (Joey) place, so Joey's place) after hanging for a bit with his friends, before getting up early
enough to make the drive to Big Sky and get warmed up.

### Race Day

As I approached the staging area for the resort in the darkness of dawn, I couldn't help but think how this seems to be starting a new chapter to my life - here I am at a race where
I don't know anyone, it's a distance that I've done before but I'll be climbing a mountain, and all in, it'll be epic if I finish. I was pumped! The temperature in the morning was 
a cool 38 *F but slated to rise up to 60 *F with clear skies - perfect racing weather. I had my backpack filled with food, water, and room for a jacket once it warmed up.

The race started in 3 heats - fast, intermediate, and slow. I think I picked the intermediate group just because I didn't want to wait any longer. We started in the dark and
immediately started climbing upwards. I was quite shocked at the fact that we were walking right at the start - wasn't this a race? Why aren't we running? So I tried running
up the hill to pass people... I quickly found out why we were walking. My legs started burning and I was moving at roughly the same speed as the walkers, but sucking 2x the
amount of air. Walking it was.

Once I figured that lesson out, the race became a little more manageable. I ran when I could, walked fast on the uphills. I tried running the downhills quickly, but was no match
for the more experienced runners. I watched their technique as they seemed to glide over rocky downhill terrain that looked like it could roll a few ankles. I tried to keep at my
own pace and not focus too much on the fact that I was being passed a lot.
