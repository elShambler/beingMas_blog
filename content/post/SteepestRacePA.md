### The Spark of the Project
A few days ago, I went on a run with the North Park Trail Runners, 
and a discussion came up about different races people signed up for. 
It inevitably led to a conversation about how tough each race is. 
Don't get me wrong, if you are doing a race, it will be challenging 
no matter what - if it's flat, you're probably pushing your body to 
go real fast; if it's a little hilly, maybe you're sprinting up all 
the hills; or if it's very steep, you'll be walking up the climbs and 
running down the hills or trotting (and even the downhill can be 
challenging based on the terrain).

So while there is no one true metric to answer the question 
of "what is the most challenging race?", 
I have attempted to answer a piece of that puzzle.

### The Races With Hills

> **It's a hill - get over it!**


In my time here in Pennsylvania, I've heard the names of different 
races thrown around - Rothrock Challenge, Megatransect, Lost Turkey, etc. 
I tried going through some of those races and quantifying the vertical gain per mile.

The tricky thing here is that not every race advertises its 
estimated elevation gain, and even if it does, you can't always 
trust it (I'm looking at you Rock'N The Knob). You also can't trust the
advertised miles - actually, nor the ruuners... well, 
especially the runners that like to challenge themselves and 
add extra off-course miles (I do this quite often... some people call it getting lost).

I put together a small list of "challening" races
and pulled out their elevation gain in feet and divided
it by the total miles of the race, based on data recorded from racers.

So far the races are as follows (in alphabetical order):

 - Call of the Wilds Marathon
 - Eastern States 100
 - Hyner View Challenge
 - Laurel Highlands Ultra
 - Megatransect
 - Rock'N the Knob
 - Rothrock Challenge

Hopefully I can update/add to this list as I do more research and get more suggestions.

### Results

![Graph of vertical gain (ft) per mile](/images/SteepPA/SteepestPARace.jpg)

By purely looking at numbers, the Wilds Marathon has the most vertical gain per mile at 258 ft/mile, 
with the Hyner View Challenge (50K) coming in closely behind it at 256 ft/mile.

Below you can see for yourself, all the numbers that went into the graph above.

### Data
Since the crux of what I'm saying relies on data that I put together, 
I think it is worthwhile noting where it came from. I tried to gather 
together blog race reports and the numbers that people reported there, 
but I was also able to track down some data from publicly available sources (i.e. Strava).

To be thorough with my results, I tried using a decent sample size to 
get an average worth reporting since I know the way GPS works varies 
between watches and the different algorithms companies utilize. 
Decent sample size meant 4 or more people (not that many, I know, 
but finding the data was hard).

##### Distance

The distance category for the race should be obvious, 
that's where you know the distance you're signing up for... 
roughly. In reality you're the Eastern States, it may depend 
on how lost you get, whereas the Rothrock Challenge, it might 
be an extra challenge.

For the most part, the quoted distance is what was obtained. 
All races cannot guarantee you'll run the exact amount, and it 
may depend on the course you take. The one interesting result 
was the Laurel Highlands coming in about 3 miles short. I haven't
run the race, so I'm not sure where the discrepancy would come in.
Potentially, the uphill + downhill gains could make up the 3 miles.

##### Elevation
This was the main data that I used for my thoughts here. 
Elevation is a tricky thing. I won't go into the details, but 
[Jeff Friedl](http://regex.info/blog/2015-05-09/2568) blogged about 
how Strava may inflate their elevation numbers. It's very difficult to 
tell, and quite honestly, I used Strava for 95% of what I did here, 
so at least they're all consistently inflated (hopefully).

I, again, used the same method of just pulling different 
racer's GPS Elevation gain data and then averaged at the end.

### Final Thoughts
Does this mean that the Wilds Marathon is the toughest race in PA? 
Heck no! The distance of the Eastern States add a whole new element 
of pain to the table. But then you have Rothrock and Megatransect 
that both add a layer of complexity with the amount of rocks and 
technical portions that also make it challenging.

The beauty of trail running is each race offers its own set of 
challenges. I think the lesson to learn here is you may need to try 
each one to determine which is the most challenging for yourself!
