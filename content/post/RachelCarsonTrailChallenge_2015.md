### The Challenge
As part of my training for my ultimate goal of the year, the Norseman Triathlon, I opted for a challening
trail race in the middle of June. Meghan, also decided to take on this challenge with me, although
she would not be running all of it, but hike and run when possible.
The Rachel Carson Trail Challenge is a ~34 mile adventure taking you on a
point-to-point trail that takes you through the North Park of Pittsburgh, and out east in a town
called _____.

The race is billed as a "Trail Challenge" because it's open to all forms of people that are willing
to challenge themselves to embark on a grueling 34 mile hike/run. While there are some people, such
as myself, that attempt to run the whole distance, a majority of the field dons their hiking gear and
trekking poles and sets out for a very long hike. No matter which way you look at it, 34 miles through
the terrain the trail is set on is no easy task.

#### Course & Terrain
** Every year, the race changes, so no two years are exactly the same. For instance, this year, they
had to make a change to the course due to construction along the trail, making the total mileage 35.9 miles.
They also switch the direction you travel -- this year was from east to west.

The trail starts in the relatively flat lands of northern Pittsburgh. There are a few stream crossings,
some exposed roots to navigate around, and a few hills. Nothing too challenging, and a good warmup. As 
you continue the journey eastward, you find a mix of country backroads, running alongside people's farmlands, 
and eventually hitting steeper climbs. Some of the steepest and most challenging climbs come along powerline right-of-ways.
These are areas that have been cleared out specificially for the powerlines to go. Often times, they go
straight up a hill, then back down. For whatever reason, the creators of the trail (maybe even the good Dr. Carson, herself),
thought this would be a good idea. Once the trail reaches the 2nd half of the course, you see the powerline
climbs much more frequently, and the running turns more into scrambling and controlled falling.

### Let's Begin
The initial start of the race is not what is typical of "races". There is no official start time, rather a general guideline
as when people should start once there is enough light. From the structure of the check-in, method of the start,
to checkpoints at the aid stations, to the finishing party, this was no ordinary race.

Meghan and I were on the road by around 3:15 AM to get to the finish and grab a ride to the start which was around 5:30.
For any other event, or race, the fact that the bus was late would have worried most people (and yes, there were
most certainly some people griping), but by and large, it wasn't a big deal. Once at the start (5:45 AM), we got all
checked in with our tracker chips, and stood in line to start.

A majority of the field had already taken off on their quest of conquering this day, and Meghan and I were ready to
go as well. The trackers were registered by little tupperware receiver computers (seriously) that read the chip presumably
as the "start" receiver. All other aid stations had similar ways of tracking the racers. I kissed Meghan good luck and
said I'd see her at the finish.

### Halfway and Beyond
Over the course of the first 18 miles, I found myself quite exhausted from a mental standpoint, and my legs seemed a bit
tired. I began to wonder if I had gone to fast in the beginning to get to open ground, or maybe the fact that my longest
run to date was a 15 mile race I did back in April? I knew I had the aerobic volume in place with my countless hours on
the bike, but did it translate well into trail running?

The weather at this point was in the mid-70s and humid. It was the temperature that is almost perfect, but is just
hot enough that everything I owned looks like I was actually running underwater. I seemed to have rationed my
food well, as I mixed solid foods with gels every 45 minutes, and taking 2 salt capsules every hour. The aid stations
offered various amounts of snacks - ranging from swedish fish and oreos, to PB&J bites and bananas; I always made
sure to capitalize on the tasty food available.

Now that I was roughly halfway, I had found out through the different people at the checkpoints that I was in 9th place.
I didn't think that was possible since I had started so late, but I was not going to contest what they were saying.

Beyond the halfway point featured many more of the fabled powerline climbs, where there would be straight up, then
straight down. Sometimes, the footing was manageable, but other times, it was slick from dew and day old mud.
This began to take a toll on my knees, as I was essentially jumping down each step.

By the time I reached the final checkpoint, I was quite exhausted. I knew there were 8 miles left, but wasn't sure
how tough the terrain was between these points. I remember having a sort of mental shift where I went from feeling
quite confident to hoping I didn't see any more powerlines and that the finish line was just around the next bend.
This sort of plodding and lack of mental activity seemed to keep me going right down to the end. My time or rank
was of little concern, rather getting to rest at the end was at the top of my priority list.

### Finishing
A cruel form of punishment I learned to hate from my years of crew is being tricked into thinking you're almost done.
I knew that the finish line was at Harrisson Hills, and saw the sign saying I was entering the park - but did that mean
